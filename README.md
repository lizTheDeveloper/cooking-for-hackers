Recipes
==========

This is literally a repository of recipies that I make. 
It has a python script that can like, make shopping lists.

Mostly, I just wanted to keep my recipes in text format because building a complicated thing seemed like a lot more work that I wanted to do up front. Maybe this will evolve into something badass, maybe not.

I'm a normal human who works and has friends, so I tend to shop at Trader Joe's and sometimes I use Good Eggs to deliver interesting veggies I can't get there, as well as weird sauces. Most of the stuff I use is attainable if you live in the bay area, for not a zillion dollars. I'll try to mention when to splurge and when to just cheat in the recipes. 

I'm totally taking pull requests. Make sure the recipe has this metadata up front:

{
	title: "awesome food",
	serves: "a number or some words",
	ingredients: ["strings describing the stuff you need to make this"],
	tools: ["Stuff you need to make the food", "frying pan is a good example"],
	type: "whether or not it's an entire meal, entree, side dish, dessert, or snack"
} 

Then, describe how to cook it.

Stick a newline at the end of recipes.
