Recipes
==========

This is literally a repository of recipies that I make. 
It has a python script that can like, make shopping lists.

Mostly, I just wanted to keep my recipes in text format because building a complicated thing seemed like a lot more work that I wanted to do up front. Maybe this will evolve into something badass, maybe not.

I'm totally taking pull requests. Make sure the recipe has this metadata up front:

{
	title: "awesome food",
	serves: "a number or some words",
	ingredients: ["strings describing the stuff you need to make this"],
	tools: ["Stuff you need to make the food", "frying pan is a good example"],
	type: "whether or not it's an entire meal, entree, side dish, dessert, or snack"
} 

Then, describe how to cook it.

Stick a newline at the end of recipes.
