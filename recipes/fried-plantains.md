if savory:

	Ok, so start by mixing up some water, about 3 cloves worth of garlic all smushed up (or the pre-smushed garlic from trader joes), and some salt. This is for putting all of the plantains in later, so enough water for that

if sweet: 
	Put water in a bowl. Enough for all the plantains to be soaking in it. Don't soak em yet.


Start heating the oil you've picked, on medium. For this I like vegetable oil. Don't fry things in olive oil, olive oil can't stand up to the heat of frying and it will break down and release gasses that are bad for you. I know someone told you canola or vegetable oil is bad, but what's really bad is frying all of your damn food. Eat fried stuff sparingly and use whatever the hell oil you want to. There's no magical oil that makes fried food not bad for you.

Here's a while loop that should describe your flow:

while you_have_more_plantains:

	Cut a single plantain into slices about half an inch to an inch thick.

	Put the plantain slices into the oil that has now probably heated up.

	Cut more plantains.

	Flip over the plantains that are in the pan after about a minuite or so.

	Put the plantains you just cut into the pan, maybe on the other half of the pan.

	Cut more plantains.

	Remove the batch that's now been fried on both sides, put them on your paper towels or whatever you have on hand. Stand em on their edges and press on the other edge, which should squeeze out a bunch of the grease and turn them into little oblong things. Put these in the water to soak, make sure the water and garlic are stirred up.

	Add more plantains to the pan.

	Flip the plantains that are in the pan from before.

After the plantains have soaked in water for a minuite, pull em out and put them on different paper towels and let them dry. 
After all your plantains have gone through the frying - water soaking process, put them back in the oil and fry them again until for about 4 minuites in total (make sure they get flipped.) 

if savory:
	Put them in a bowl and add a bit more garlic and salt to them. Serve hot.

if sweet: 
	Put them in a bowl, add brown sugar and cinnamon, and allspice if you have it. Serve hot or with ice cream.
