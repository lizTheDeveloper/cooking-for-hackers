Slice some bigass carrots, maybe two or three, on your mandolin on the "thin slices" setting. What's that you say? You don't have a mandolin? Get your ass a mandolin. How the fuck do you slice veggies without a mandolin? With a knife? Get the fuck out of here with that amateur shit.

Grab some mushrooms. Like, a handful, maybe more depending on how much you like mushrooms.

Put them in a bowl big enough for the amount of mass you're dealing with right now. We're just going to add spices so it's not going to add much.

Drizzle enough olive oil to cover all the things if you were to toss it around a bit. We're going to be frying them, so like, a quarter cup of oil is probably too much unless you're making a lot of carrots and mushrooms.

Put some balsamic vinegar on the carrots and mushrooms in the bowl. There's this like, blackberry balsamic vinegar that's pretty awesome so if you can find that, great. Otherwise, some balsamic vinegar on the sweeter side would be good. 
Protip: If you keep it in the fridge it stays sweeter longer. If you leave it outside of the fridge, it goes bad and sour and then tricks you into thinking you don't like balsamic vinegar for like 6 years. 

I like to put pepper on them too - kind of a sweet-spicy thing goin' on. If you want to add other spices, go for savory, and not stuff you'd find in a pumpkin pie. I don't recommend rosemary, just because it's too grassy and hard to get out. 

You can do this two ways - fast or slow. Do it slow if you're waiting for something to roast, fast if you're almost at the end of the meal prep and you want everything to come out at once.

Slow:
When you're ready, put a frying pan on the range and turn the burner on to about medium heat. Pour the carrots into the frying pan and push em around every once in awhile - like once every two minutes. Do this for like, 15 minutes, or until the carrots are malleable instead of hard. Don't do it for too long and let them get too soft like boiled carrots because those are both lame and gross.

Fast:
Turn the heat up and sear everything. The carrots will mostly be the ones that taste different here - being more crunchy instead of softer - but if you sear the outside enough, to where it is brown on the edges, it will also end up being hella good.
