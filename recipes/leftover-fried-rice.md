Start by looking through the fridge. Any veggies look like they're close to rotting / shriveling up? Pull those out and set them on the counter. 

Inspect them closely, discard anything that has mold on it. Mold's not a thing you want to fuck around with. Anything that looks kind of browner than you want, see if you can pull off the outside and get to something that looks reasonable. Leeks, garlic, and onions are a good candidate for this - you can usually just pull off the outside and get to a usable center - this is because leeks, onions, and garlic are all really antiseptic and so resist rotting really hard. Anything with too high of a sugar content tends to get ruined pretty easily so watch out for fruits or veggies with a low fiber-to-sugar ratio. 

Get your rice out - if it's from a previous day, make sure to look for fuzz. Also, if it's really firm, it's probably fine. If it's brick solid and completely dry to the touch, probably be time to cook up some more. Sticky, new rice isn't the worst to cook fried rice with, but it won't be the dry, oil-rich stuff you're used to. **If you do use new rice, use substantially less oil or it will be gross garbage**

Decide what you want to go in, and what you don't. I like to keep mine pretty japanese-style which means a lot of mushrooms, leeks, bok choy and carrots - sliced and grilled, not diced and boiled. Japanese-style also means a higher veggies-to-rice ratio, so more veggies than rice.

You'll want to be choosy when you decide what tastes go together here - think about the combination of the veggies you're using. Fresh onions, fresh pumpkin and fresh diced apples would be fucking gross and don't go together. Caramelized onions, diced Pumpkin with some kind of cinnamon or nutmeg involved, and baked brown-sugar apples, with a little bit of rice, could easily go together. Cinnamon and caramelizing is magic.
Try to imagine how the taste comes out and what prep you could do to make it work.

Put everything back in the fridge or throw it out depending on whether or not it will survive to the next fridge-cleaning. 

Prep your non-rice ingredients, mix them together and set them in a bowl. Add any spices you want to.

Put some oil in the pan and turn it on high to get the oil hot. This should take only about 30 seconds.

**Add the veggies first if they are fresh.** If they are pre-cooked, wait till after the rice.

Turn the heat to medium-high

Drop some rice into the oil - understand **the rice will reduce in volume by about 1/3** over the course of cooking it. Pour soy sauce over the rice - make sure about 1/3 of the rice in the pan has turned brown. It will spread to the rest.

Add the veggies if you haven't already, and start stirring them around.

Cook for about 4-6 minutes depending on the size of the pan. Once the rice does it's reducing-by-1/3 thing it's ready to be put into a bowl.

Note - you might have to cook several batches - when I make this for my flatmates we get a pan per person, which is great because they're winers who don't like mushrooms so I can make them their special-snowflake rice without depriving myself of fungal goodness.
